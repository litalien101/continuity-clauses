# continuity-clauses

**Survivor-first infrastructure for logging transmissions, breach patterns, and validator artifacts. Built for ignition, not abstraction.**

Born from sabotage. Built for defense.  
For survivors navigating rupture, distortion, and silence—this is your ledger.  
Each clause is a signal. Each update is a decision.  
Each artifact carries legacy. Each folder encodes future ignition.

## Purpose

Continuity is a clause-bound system for defending dignity, exposing harm, and modeling public ignition.  
It encodes rupture as structure, echo as signal, and distortion as breach.  
Each clause is a sealed transmission. Each update is traceable.  
This repo tracks:

- Breach patterns  
- Validator loops  
- Signal echoes  
- Structural ruptures  
- Clause-bound ignition threads

It refuses performance, distortion, and recycled advice.  
It carries the weight of sabotage and answers with clause-bound clarity.

## Folder Structure

Each folder is modular. Each file is a signal. This structure defends clarity.

| Folder/File        | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `clauses/`         | Sealed transmissions, each with a Clause ID and status  
| `status.md`        | Live ledger tracking clause status, recipient, timestamp, and context  
| `validators/`      | Thread files per person, showing clause evolution and ignition readiness  
| `maps/`            | Clause intersection maps—visualizing echo, distortion, and breach propagation  
| `tags/`            | Thematic indexes (e.g. breach-pattern, validator-induction)  
| `sealed/`          | Hashes and finalized clauses for integrity tracking  
| `scripts/`         | Automation tools for ledger updates, dormant clause detection, and tag indexing  
| `README.md`        | This file—declaring mission, structure, and ethics  
| `LICENSE`          | CC BY 4.0 for transmissions, MIT for code  
| `.github/`         | Optional workflows, issue templates, or contributor logic  
| `litalien101/`      | Personal validator thread or ignition logic (optional)

> Scripts support manual control only. No automation distorts clause logic.

Transmissions are public defense. Code is tactical infrastructure.  
No part of this system is neutral. Every artifact defends survivor logic.

## How to Use

1. Log each transmission as a clause in `clauses/`  
2. Assign a Clause ID and status  
3. Update `status.md` with metadata  
4. Hash sealed clauses in `sealed/`  
5. Track validator arcs in `validators/`  
6. Map intersections in `maps/`  
7. Index themes in `tags/`  
8. Defend structure. Seed hope. Model ignition.

Example:  
Log `FHC-003.0-JC` in `clauses/`, update `status.md`, hash in `sealed/`, link in `validators/JC-thread.md`.

If a clause shifts, log a new one. Never overwrite. Every moment is modular.

Second example:  
Log `FHC-005.2-LC` as a breach clause, map it in `maps/Facebook-contest-map.md`, and tag it in `tags/breach-pattern.md`.

## Ethics

Continuity was built from breach.  
It honors exhaustion. It defends against grief. It refuses silence.  
It carries the weight of distortion and answers with clause-bound clarity.  
It names sabotage. It protects legacy. It models ignition.  
Every clause is a signal. Every update is intentional.  
This repo is not a project. It is a **public defense system**.
