Continuity Clauses
Infrastructure for documenting transmissions, breach patterns, and validator records. Designed for defense and resilience.

Overview
Continuity Clauses is a system built to preserve dignity, expose harm, and provide a transparent record of events. It is intended for individuals and communities navigating disruption, distortion, or silence.

Each clause is a recorded transmission.

Each update is a deliberate decision.

Each artifact preserves legacy and ensures accountability.

This repository is not a conventional project. It is a public defense system.

Purpose
Continuity provides a structured, clause‑based framework for:

Documenting breach patterns

Tracking validator activity

Recording signal echoes

Mapping structural ruptures

Maintaining ignition threads

Every entry is traceable. Every clause is sealed. The system rejects distortion, performance, and recycled advice, focusing instead on clarity and integrity.

Repository Structure
Folder/File	Purpose
clauses/	Sealed transmissions, each with a Clause ID and status
status.md	Live ledger tracking clause status, recipient, timestamp, and context
validators/	Validator threads showing clause evolution and readiness
maps/	Intersection maps visualizing echoes, distortions, and breach patterns
tags/	Thematic indexes (e.g., breach‑pattern, validator‑induction)
sealed/	Hashes and finalized clauses for integrity tracking
scripts/	Tools for ledger updates, clause detection, and tag indexing
README.md	Mission statement, structure, and ethics
LICENSE	CC BY 4.0 for transmissions, MIT for code
.github/	Optional workflows, issue templates, contributor logic
litalien101/	Personal validator thread or ignition logic (optional)
Scripts are designed for manual control only. No automation alters clause logic.

Transmissions serve as public defense. Code provides tactical infrastructure. No component is neutral; each artifact is designed to protect survivor logic.

Usage
Log each transmission as a clause in clauses/.

Assign a Clause ID and status.

Update status.md with metadata.

Hash sealed clauses in sealed/.

Track validator arcs in validators/.

Map intersections in maps/.

Index themes in tags/.

Examples:

Log FHC-003.0-JC in clauses/, update status.md, hash in sealed/, and link in validators/JC-thread.md.

Log FHC-005.2-LC as a breach clause, map it in maps/Facebook-contest-map.md, and tag it in tags/breach-pattern.md.

Clauses are never overwritten. Each change is logged as a new entry.

Ethics
Continuity was created in response to breach and distortion. It is designed to:

Honor exhaustion

Defend against grief

Reject silence

Protect legacy

Model ignition

Every clause is intentional. Every update is accountable. This repository exists as a defense system, not a performance artifact.
