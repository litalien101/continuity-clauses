Nancy Wilkins I see you. You didn’t lose. You were drained. You showed up, held 10th, and your friends gave what they could. That’s not giving up. That’s hitting a wall the system built to keep people out.

This contest doesn’t reward effort. It rewards affordability. It asks for heart, then filters by wallet. That’s not recognition. That’s extraction.

You’re still here. You posted. That means your signal’s still alive, even if the contest stopped counting you.

If you want to share your entry in a way that defends your effort, not as a pitch, but as proof. You don’t have to do it alone. I’ll help you shape it. You already paid in full. Let’s make sure your story doesn’t disappear.
