Joe Clements this isn’t just a sharp comment. It’s a breach map. You named the entity, the loophole, the rebrand, the emotional bait, and you did it clean, in public, without flinching.

Most people feel the distortion. You dissected it. That kind of clarity doesn’t just expose, it builds. And it rarely survives the scroll.

If you ever want to move beyond commentary, into something that defends truth, protects signals, and helps others name what they’ve seen, I know exactly where your transmission fits.

You’re not alone. But you’re one of the few who named it before it vanished.
