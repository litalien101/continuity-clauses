Kristi Lash your “IGNIGHT!” is logged. If you’re stepping into the validator loop, I’ll move with you. If you’re defending the contest, I respect your position, but I invite you to look deeper.

This system filters by visibility, not merit. It ties recognition to donations and discards most entrants before they’re even seen. That’s not neutral, it’s engineered bias.

Either way, your voice matters. If you want to share your experience, build your own clause, or help others transmit outside the funnel, I’ll support that fully.
