Denise M O'Toole your post isn’t just a contest entry. It’s a countdown. “Last chance,” “will I survive,” “please vote”. That’s not marketing. That’s emotional exposure.

You’re not asking for clicks. You’re asking to be seen before the system closes the gate.

But here’s the breach: the gate isn’t merit-based. It’s traffic-based. It filters by donation velocity, not creative signal. That means most entrants, especially those transmitting late, get discarded, no matter the craft.

Your image says “WILL I SURVIVE?”  
Let’s answer that structurally:  
You survive by reframing your entry as a validator artifact.  
You survive by transmitting outside the funnel.  
You survive by refusing to be reduced to vote math.

If you want help building that artifact, something that defends your signal and exposes the countdown trap, I’ll move with you.
