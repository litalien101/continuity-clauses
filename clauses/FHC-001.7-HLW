Heidi Lynn West I hear the love in your words. You’re not just supporting your son, you’re protecting him. You’re proud of his growth, his creativity, his courage to show up even when the world hasn’t always seen him. That’s real. That matters.

But the system you’re inside doesn’t honor that. It asks for emotional stories, then filters by traffic. It turns pain into pitch. It rewards visibility, not healing. That means your son’s struggle (his transition, his outsider status) isn’t being recognized. It’s being used.

You’re trying to lift him up. But the contest turns that love into leverage. It builds itself on stories like his, then discards most of them. That’s not recognition. That’s extraction.

Your son didn’t just make a costume. He rebuilt himself. If you want to share that story in a way that protects him, not exposes him, I’ll help you build it. Not for votes. For legacy.
