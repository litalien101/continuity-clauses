Jackie Hanson your optimism is real, and I respect it. But let’s not confuse anecdote with architecture.

You say you’re in first place with three votes. That’s possible, but it doesn’t dismantle the funnel. It just means your group is small, or under-engaged. The system still filters by visibility. Still ties recognition to donations. Still discards most signals before they’re seen.

And yes, Halloween wears many faces. But when the contest sells visibility as merit, and uses charity to justify filtration, it stops being celebration. It becomes distortion.

If you want to defend the cause, help make it transparent. Show us the group counts. The judging criteria. The winner archive. Otherwise, “have fun” becomes a mask for engineered harm.
