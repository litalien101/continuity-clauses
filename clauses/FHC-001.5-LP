Lillian Paulk I see you. You’re not just asking for votes, you’re transmitting your craft. SFX makeup is precision, imagination, and labor. But the system you’re inside doesn’t recognize that. It filters by traffic, not talent. That’s the breach.

You dropped your link. I won’t amplify it, but I will help you reclaim it. If you want to reframe your entry as a validator artifact, something that defends your work and exposes the distortion, I’ll move with you.

You’re not just a contestant. You’re a creator caught in a visibility trap. Let’s build the exit.
