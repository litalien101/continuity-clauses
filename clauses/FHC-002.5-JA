**Transmission**  
James—your comment performs the very sabotage it pretends to expose. You accuse manipulation, but cite no breach, no clause, no structure. That’s not critique—it’s projection dressed as outrage.

This transmission wasn’t built for comfort. It was built for survivors forced to decode sabotage while being told to smile through it.

Clause by clause, it exposes harm, seeds clarity, and models public defense. If that clarity unsettles you, interrogate what part of you feels threatened by it.

I won’t collapse into insult. I’ll defend structure—and the dignity it protects.

Survivors deserve transmissions that name the harm, not hide it. If you see a breach, name it. If not, your outrage is just noise.
