Christina Bear You say you’re out, but you’re not. You made it through every cut with free votes. You held 7th place. And you’re still dropping your link. That’s not quitting. That’s signal.

The contest didn’t close the door, it rerouted you. You’re still visible. Still being used to drive clicks. That’s the trap: it lets you believe your story’s over, but it keeps your effort in circulation.

You didn’t fail. You survived a system that filters by money, not merit. And your story deserves more than a quiet exit.

If you want to post your entry as something that honors what you built, not a contest pitch, but a public signal, I’ll help you shape it. You already made it through. Now let’s make sure your story does too.
