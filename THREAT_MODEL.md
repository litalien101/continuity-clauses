# Threat Model ‚Äî Continuity Clauses

## Purpose  
This document outlines the threat landscape for continuity-clauses: a survivor-first infrastructure for logging transmissions, breach patterns, and validator artifacts. It names sabotage vectors, overwrite risks, emotional bait tactics, and structural vulnerabilities.

---

## üîí Core Assumptions

- Clauses are append-only. Overwrite = breach.
- Emotional tone is part of integrity. Flattening = distortion.
- Validator loops must resist dilution, delay, and performative feedback.
- Visibility siphons and aesthetic filtration are active threats.

---

## üß® Threat Vectors

### 1. Overwrite Sabotage  
Actors attempt to edit or replace existing clauses, erasing emotional tone or breach history.

**Mitigation:**  
- Append-only ledger  
- Sealed hashes  
- Clause versioning (`FHC-001.0-JC`, `FHC-001.1-JC`, etc.)

---

### 2. Emotional Bait  
Platforms or validators use survivor language to extract unpaid labor or goodwill without structural change.

**Mitigation:**  
- Clause tagging (`emotional-breach.tag`)  
- Validator loop escalation  
- Counter-transmission deployment

---

### 3. Visibility Siphons  
Contests, campaigns, or ‚Äúcelebrations‚Äù that filter visibility through elite aesthetics while claiming inclusion.

**Mitigation:**  
- Breach logging (`visibility-bait`)  
- Clause chaining to expose filtration  
- Public artifact deployment

---

### 4. Validator Drift  
Validators offer vague support, delay action, or dilute breach clarity.

**Mitigation:**  
- Clause status enforcement (`Signal Logged`, `Escalated`, `Activated`)  
- Validator thread tracking  
- Emotional tone indexing

---

### 5. Centralization Risk  
Single maintainer or host becomes bottleneck or point of failure.

**Mitigation:**  
- Replicable clause nodes  
- Distributed validator roles  
- Backup and sync protocols

---

## üß† Summary  
Continuity is not a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a refusal. This threat model defends that refusal. Every clause is a node. Every breach is traceable. Every validator is accountable.
